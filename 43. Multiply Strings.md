## 43. Multiply Strings
-------
### Introduction

The Problem gives us two integer but represented as strings, for example, "123" and "456". As a result, we should return the product of two integer and also represented as a string, for example, "56088". And apparently, we are not allowed to use bulit-in functions or convert input into integer directly.

## Solution 1

There are several things that we need to know before we work on that problem.
* if `a` digits number multiply `b` digits number, then the number of digits of the product is between `a+b` and `a+b+1`
* how to convert a char(from '1' to '9' ) into an integer number:  
```
  char a = '5';  
  int res = a - '0';
```
