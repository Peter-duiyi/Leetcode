## 43. Multiply Strings

### Introduction

The Problem gives us two integer but represented as strings, for example, "123" and "456". As a result, we should return the product of two integer and also represented as a string, for example, "56088". And apparently, we are not allowed to use bulit-in functions or convert input into integer directly.

## Solution 1

There are several things that we need to know before we work on that problem.
* if `a` digits number multiply `b` digits number, then the number of digits of the product is between `a+b` and `a+b+1`
* how to convert a char(from '1' to '9' ) into an integer:  
```
  char a = '5';  
  int b = a - '0';
```
* how to convert an integer into a char:
```
  int a = 5;
  char b = a + '0';
```
Now Let's start looking at this problem.  
My first solution here is based on some articles online, which I will refer to below.  
Suppose we have two number `123` and `456`, then the idea is we set a vector or an array, or even a string(which is little different) to store each digit of the product. As we mentioned above, we can set the the vector size to 6(3+3), and initial the vector with 0s.
```

After that, we are going to use for-loops to go through the digits of each number and get the product of each digit. for example, `3*6`, `3*5`, `3*4` and so on. Based on the index in the for-loops we will decide which place of the vector will store the value. One thing that should be noticed is we only store the unit and we put the carry to next place in the vector.

Finally, we get a vector of digits and we convert it into a string. But we should also notice it might be 0 since the multiplier can be 0. And one 0 might be at head.

## Code 1

```
class Solution {
public:
    string multiply(string num1, string num2) {
        int len1 = num1.size();
        int len2 = num2.size();
        int len = len1 + len2;
        string res;       //final res
        vector<int> prod(len, 0); // store each digit of the product, initial 0
        
        //edge case
        if(len1 * len2 == 0) return res;
        
        //it will be much more convenient
        reverse(num1.begin(), num1.end());
        reverse(num2.begin(), num2.end());
        
        for(int i = 0; i < len1; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < len2; j++){
                int mul = (num1[i] - '0') * (num2[j] - '0');
                // we get the product, but for final result of that digit, we still need to add a carry
                mul += prod[i + j];
                // we store digit at prod[i + j], store carry at prod[i + j + 1], 
                prod[i + j] = mul % 10; // digit, change the number
                prod[i + j + 1] += mul / 10; // carry, add to itself
            }
        }
        
        reverse(prod.begin(), prod.end()); // reverse the vector
        
        for(int i = 0; i < prod.size(); i++){
            cout << prod[i] << ' ';
        }
        cout << endl;
        //now we have our result stored in the prod[] with digits seperated
        //but we need to be careful of two cases
        //1. the result may not fully occupy all the digits, which means there might be 0s at the head of the prod[]
        //2. the case that one of the multiplier is 0
        
        //a digits number multiply b digits number
        //the digits of result is always between a+b and a+b+1
        //so if the first digit is 0, then it might be case a+b
        //if the following digit is also 0, then the result is 0
        
        int index = 0;        
        while(prod[index] == 0 && index < len){
            index++;
        }
        if(index == prod.size()) return "0";
        for(int i = index; i < prod.size(); i++){
            res += prod[i] + '0';
        }
        return res;
    }
};
