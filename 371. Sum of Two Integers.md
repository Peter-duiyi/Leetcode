## 371. Sum of Two Integers

### Introduction

The Problem gives us two integer but represented as strings, for example, "123" and "456". As a result, we should return the product of two integer and also represented as a string, for example, "56088". And apparently, we are not allowed to use bulit-in functions or convert input into integer directly.

### Solution 1

There are several things that we need to know before we work on that problem.
* what is the result of if(-1)
* why we sort at first
```
  char a = '5';  
  int b = a - '0';
```
* how to convert an integer into a char:
```
  int a = 5;
  char b = a + '0';
```
Now Let's start looking at this problem.  
My first solution here is based on some articles online, which I will refer to below.  
Suppose we have two number `123` and `456`, then the idea is we set a vector or an array, or even a string(which is little different) to store each digit of the product. As we mentioned above, we can set the the vector size to 6(3+3), and initial the vector with 0s.
```

```
After that, we are going to use for-loops to go through the digits of each number and get the product of each digit. for example, `3*6`, `3*5`, `3*4` and so on. Based on the index in the for-loops we will decide which place of the vector will store the value. One thing that should be noticed is we only store the unit and we put the carry to next place in the vector.

Finally, we get a vector of digits and we convert it into a string. But we should also notice it might be 0 since the multiplier can be 0. And one 0 might be at head.

### Code 1

```
/*
//recursive
class Solution {
public:
    int getSum(int a, int b) {
        return (a & b) << 1 == 0 ? a xor b : getSum(a xor b, (a & b) << 1);
    }
};
*/

//iterative
class Solution {
public:
    int getSum(int a, int b) {
        while(b){
            int carry = (a & b) << 1;
            int temp = a xor b;
            a = temp;
            b = carry;
        }
        return a;
    }
};

```
