## 62. Unique Paths

### Introduction

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
        dp[0][0] = 1;
        for(size_t i = 0; i < m; i++){
            for(size_t j = 0; j < n; j++){
                if(i == 0 && j > 0) dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1];
                if(j == 0 && i > 0) dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j];
                if(i > 0 && j > 0) dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1];
            }
        }
        return dp[m-1][n-1];
